Myriasecond Clock
=================

Inspired by an article on [Geoff Vedernikoff's](https://github.com/yefim) [blog](http://blog.yef.im/), this is a simple clock which displays the current time in Myriaseconds.

The look is achieved via CSS3 generated gradients, and [NProgress](http://ricostacruz.com/nprogress/), a nice little progress bar library by [Rico Cruz](https://github.com/rstacruz/nprogress).

The clock is up and running at [http://frqnc.net/code/myria-clock](http://frqnc.net/code/myria-clock)
